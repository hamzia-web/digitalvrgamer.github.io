It is usually recommended to identify the underlying cause of pain, track disease progression or monitor the effectiveness of treatment. X-rays are blocked by your bones but pass easily through the rest of your body, hence X-rays are widely used to find bony abnormalities such as fractures in the body.
                    Some of the other conditions that may warrant an X-ray study include arthritis, osteoporosis, infections, dental problems, infections, swallowed items and abnormalities in the lungs or chest.

                    <p class="mt-2 p-1">A broken bone is a common event. Given time and the right care, the bone is able to heal itself. A plaster cast is applied to hold the arm or leg fracture in place while the bone heals.
                    On average, plaster casts stay on for about six weeks. This time is sometimes longer or shorter, depending on your age, general health and type of fracture. During this time, x-rays are done by <b>Shefa Digital X-Ray</b> to check that the bone is healing well. If there are problems with the type of fracture or the way in which the fracture is healing, you may be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (bone doctor).
                    Fractures can be painful. The pain can be extreme at the beginning but it will ease when the plaster is on and the fractured limb is supported and rested.
