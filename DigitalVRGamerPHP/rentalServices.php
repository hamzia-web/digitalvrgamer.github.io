We offer this option at the best prices and you will not have to worry about the maintenance of the device as it will be done by us! Our kits include all required controllers, tracking sensors, the headset and, if required, a VR-ready computer.
                      The Oculus Rift was the first real Virtual Reality headset and has improved ever since. It is now a worthy competitor to the HTC Vive and is able to show Virtual Reality in high definition at a full 360 degrees. With the easy-to-use controllers, you can interact with the virtual environment.</p>
