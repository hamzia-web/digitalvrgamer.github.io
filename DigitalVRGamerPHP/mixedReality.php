It means placing new imagery within a real space in such a way that the new imagery is able to interact, to an extent, with what is real in the physical world we know. The key characteristic of MR is that the synthetic content and the real-world content are able to react to each other in real time. Integrating Mixed reality in healthcare is a common occurrence in 2020. The sphere is constantly growing encouraging lots of medical institutions to put up in it.
                    Reports and Data predicted that MR in the healthcare market will attain a value of $7+ Billion by 2026. Healthcare organizations decide to invest in MR after examining all the advantages it brings in.

                    Mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) are more abstract concept than AR and VR. Since they aren’t technology itself, but combination of these technologies. The general understanding is that MR is in between of AR and VR and XR is an over-compassing term that includes AR, VR and MR. However this just makes everything confusing and add irrelevant complexity to everything.</p>

The general understanding is that MR is in between of AR and VR and XR is an over-compassing term that includes AR, VR and MR. However this just makes everything confusing and add irrelevant complexity to everything. One of the most used explanation on the web is through the use of reality-virtuality spectrum.</p>
