Several car dealerships around the world are experimenting with how augmented reality can improve customer service and drive sales.
                              How Augmented Reality is used in Car Retail
                              Imagine being able to place a life-size 3D image of the car you are considering in your driveway. The technology is so good that you’d be able to walk around the car, open the door and peer inside it. It offers an intriguing try-it-before-you-buy it opportunity to prospective car buyers.
                              Car dealerships can use AR on their website to bring augmented-reality experiences to prospective car buyers online.</p>
