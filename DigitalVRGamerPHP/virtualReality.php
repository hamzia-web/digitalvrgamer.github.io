                    Virtual Reality is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life.”
                    Mark Zuckerberg, CEO Facebook. The biggest misconception is that there’s only games in VR. Partly that’s because if you have an HTC Vive or an Oculus Rift the coolest things are games. I’ve watched many things from music, to journalism, to narrative experiences (we used to call them movies), to sports, to education. VR isn’t just for games, and if you are at Disney you know that, its new Disneyland in China was designed in VR, for instance, and Ford has a special VR room at its R&D lab in Silicon Valley to design cars for the future

                    <p class="mt-2">Virtual reality (VR) implies a complete immersion experience that shuts out the physical world. Using VR devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, users can be transported into a number of real-world and imagined environments such as the middle of a squawking penguin colony or even the back of a dragon. This sophisticated tools allow learners to plunge safely into life-or-death scenarios, peel away layers of human anatomy, walk through a virtual heart, and more. As technologies from the gaming industry improve and costs decline, leaders in academic medicine are increasingly exploring the place of such simulations in medical education.</p>

Users simply install the free Google Cardboard app on their smartphones, then mount the device to the cardboard headset. Making the experience seamless is a Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip embedded in the headset that automatically launches the app whenever users slide the phone into the headset. A capacitive touch button on the top allows users a limited ability to interact with what they see on the phone's screen through the headset's adjustable lenses. Additionally, the Cardboard Camera app turns smartphones into VR cameras.</p>
