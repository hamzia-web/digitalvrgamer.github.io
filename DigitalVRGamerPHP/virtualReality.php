                    Virtual Reality (VR) is an immersive experience also called a computer-simulated reality. It refers to computer technologies using reality headsets to generate the realistic sounds, images and other sensations that replicate a real environment or create an imaginary world. VR is a way to immerse users in an entirely virtual world. A true VR environment will engage all five senses (taste, sight, smell, touch, sound), but it is important to say that this is not always possible.
                    Today, it is easy to say that VR is a well-established new reality-tech. Moreover, after years of popularity in the gaming industry, we are now seeing this technology into more practical applications. The market and the industry are still excited about this tech trend and further progress is expected in the near future

Using VR devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, users can be transported into a number of real-world and imagined environments such as the middle of a squawking penguin colony or even the back of a dragon. This sophisticated tools allow learners to plunge safely into life-or-death scenarios, peel away layers of human anatomy, walk through a virtual heart, and more. As technologies from the gaming industry improve and costs decline, leaders in academic medicine are increasingly exploring the place of such simulations in medical education.</p>

Users simply install the free Google Cardboard app on their smartphones, then mount the device to the cardboard headset. Making the experience seamless is a Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip embedded in the headset that automatically launches the app whenever users slide the phone into the headset. A capacitive touch button on the top allows users a limited ability to interact with what they see on the phone's screen through the headset's adjustable lenses. Additionally, the Cardboard Camera app turns smartphones into VR cameras.</p>
