                        physical environment, is coming to a car showroom near you. Several car dealerships around the
                        world are experimenting with how augmented reality can improve customer service and drive sales.
                        How Augmented Reality is used in Car Retail
                        Imagine being able to place a life-size 3D image of the car you are considering in your
                        driveway. The technology is so good that you’d be able to walk around the car, open the door and
                        peer inside it. It offers an intriguing try-it-before-you-buy it opportunity to prospective car
                        buyers.
                        Car dealerships can use AR on their website to bring augmented-reality experiences to
                        prospective car buyers online.
                        Augmented Reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment
                        whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as
                        sound, video, graphics or GPS data. As AR exists on top of our own world it provides as much
                        freedom as you are given within your normal life. AR utilizes your existing reality and adds to
                        it utilizing a device of some sort. Mobile and tablets are the most popular mediums of AR now,
                        through the camera, the apps put an overlay of digital content into the environment. Custom
                        headsets are also being used. As popular AR examples there are Pokemon Go and Snapchat’s new AR
                        bitmojis.
